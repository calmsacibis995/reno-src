Oh, where do I begin...

1. 98628A (single port buffered RS232) driver needs work (read: rewrite).
2. Test SLIP code on serial interfaces.
3. Integrate 1/2" 9-track reel tape driver (from Mt Xinu).
4. Do away with DMA timeouts.
5. SCSI: sync support and connect/disconnect.
6. VME adaptor driver.
7. Centronics driver for 345/375.
8. HP-IB (SCSI?) improvement: attempt to get more activity on a single
   bus (e.g. overlap seeks with transfers).
9. Disk labels.
