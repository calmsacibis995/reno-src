.Sh NAME
.Nm script
.Nd make typescript of terminal session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm script
.Op Fl a
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Script
makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.
It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive
session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file 
can be printed out later with
.Xr lpr 1 .
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar file
is given,
.Nm
saves all dialogue in
.Ar file .
If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file
.Pa typescript  .
.Pp
Option:
.Tw Ds
.Tp Fl a
Append the output to
.Ar file
or
.Pa typescript ,
retaining the prior contents.
.Tp
.Pp
The script ends when the forked shell exits (a
.Em control-D
to exit
the Bourne shell
.Pf \&( Xr sh 1 ) ,
and
.Em exit , 
.Em logout
or
.Em control-d
(if
.Em ignoreeof
is not set) for the
C-shell,
.Xr csh 1 ) .
.Pp
Certain interactive commands, such as
.Xr vi 1 ,
create garbage in the typescript file.
.Nm Script
works best with commands that do not manipulate the
screen, the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy
terminal.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable is utilized by
.Nm script :
.Tw SHELL
.Tp Ev SHELL
If the variable
.Ev SHELL
exists, the shell forked by
.Nm script
will be that shell. If
.Ev SHELL
is not set, the Bourne shell
is assumed. (Most shells set this variable automatically).
.Tp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1
(for the
.Em history
mechanism).
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Script
appeared in 3 BSD.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Script
places
.Sy everything
in the log file, including linefeeds and backspaces.
This is not what the naive user expects.
