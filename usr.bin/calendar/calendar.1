.Nm calendar
.Nd reminder service
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm calendar
.Op  \-a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Calendar
checks the current directory for a file named named
.Li calendar
and displays lines that begin with either today's date
or tomorrow's.
On Fridays, events on Friday through Monday are displayed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Tp Fl a
Process the ``calendar'' files of all users and mail the results
to them.
This requires super-user privileges.
.Tp
.Pp
A month and day should begin lines.
They may be entered in almost any format, either numeric or as character
strings.
A single asterisk (``*'') matches every month.
A day without a month matches that day of every week.
A month without a day matches the first of that month.
Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.
Lines with leading tabs default to the last entered date, allowing
multiple line specifications for a single date.
By convention, dates followed by an asterisk are not fixed, i.e. change
from year to year.
.Pp
The ``calendar'' file is preprocessed by
.Xr cpp 1 ,
allowing the inclusion of shared files such as company holidays or
meetings.
If the shared file is not referenced by a full pathname,
.Xr cpp 1
searches in the current (or home) directory first, and then in the
directory
.Pa /usr/share/calendar .
Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax (/* ... */)
are ignored.
.Pp
Some possible calendar entries:
.Pp
.Ds I
#include	<calendar.usholiday>
#include	<calendar.birthday>

6/15		... June 15 (if ambiguous, will default to month/day).
Jun. 15	... June 15.
15 June	... June 15.
Thursday	... Every Thursday.
June		... Every June 1st.
15 *		... 15th of every month.

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm calendar
program previously selected lines which had the correct date anywhere
in the line.
This is no longer true, the date is only recognized when it occurs
first on the line.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
The version of
.Nm calendar
released with this man page
is unrelated.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Calendar
doesn't handle events that move around from year to year, i.e.
``the last Monday in April''.
