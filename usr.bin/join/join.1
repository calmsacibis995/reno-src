.Sh NAME
.Nm join
.Nd relational database operator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm join
.Op Fl a Ar file_number
.Op Fl e Ar string
.Op Fl j Ar file_number field
.if n .br
.Op Fl o Ar list
.Op Fl t Ar char
.Op Fl v Ar file_number
.Ob
.Fl \&1
.Ar field
.Oe

.Fl \&2
.Ar field
.Oe
.Ar file1
.if n .br
.Ar file2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The join utility performs an ``equality join'' on the files
.Ar file1
and
.Ar file2 .
The joined files are written to the standard
output.
.Pp
The ``join field'' is a field in each file on which the
files are compared.
There is one line in the output for
each pair of lines in
.Ar file1
and
.Ar file2
which have identical
join fields.
The output line by default consists of the
join field, then the remaining fields from
.Ar file1 ,
then the
remaining fields from
.Ar file2 .
This format can be changed by
using the
.Fl o
option (see below).
.Pp
The files file1 and file2 should be ordered in the collating
sequence of
.Li sort -b
on the fields on which they are to be
joined, by default the first in each line; Otherwise, all
join field matches need not be reported.
.Pp
The default input field separators are <blank>s.
In this
case, multiple separators count as one field separator, and
leading separators are ignored.
The default output field
separator is a <space>.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Tw Fl
.Tc Fl a
.Ws
.Ar file_number
.Cx
In addition to the default output, produce a line
for each unpairable line in file
.Ar file_number ,
where
.Ar file_number
is 1 or 2.
.Tc Fl e
.Ws
.Ar string
.Cx
Replace empty output fields by the string
.Ar string .
.Tc Fl j
.Ws
.Ar file_number field
.Cx
Join on the
.Sf Ar field 'th
field of file
.Ar file_number .
If
.Ar file_number
is missing, (i.e., the
first digit of the option argument is neither 1 nor
2), use the
.Sf Ar field 'th
field in each file.
Fields are
decimal integers starting with 1.
.Tc Fl o
.Ws
.Ar list
.Cx
Each output line comprises the fields specified in
.Ar list ,
each element of which has the form
.Ql file_number.field ,
where
.Ar file_number
is a file
number and field is a decimal integer field number.
The elements of list are either comma or <space> separated.
The list is written only for lines with matching join fields,
and is not output unless specifically requested.
.Tc Fl t
.Ws
.Ar char
.Cx
Use character
.Ar char
as a separator, for both input
and output.
Every appearance of char in a line is
significant.
When this option is specified, the
collating sequence should be the same as sort
without the
.Fl b
option.
.Tc Fl v
.Ws
.Ar file_number
.Cx
Instead of the default output, produce a line only
for each unpairable line in
.Ar file_number ,
where
.Ar file_number
is 1 or 2.
.Tc Fl 1
.Ws
.Ar field
.Cx
Join on the
.Sf Ar field 'th
field of file 1.
Fields are
decimal integers starting with 1.
.Tc Fl 2
.Ws
.Ar field
.Cx
Join on the
.Sf Ar field 'th
field of file 2.
Fields are
decimal integers starting with 1.
.Tp
.Pp
If both
.Ql \-a 1
and
.Ql \-a 2
are specified, both sets of information
are output,
.Ql \-a 2
always first, regardless of the specified
order.
.Pp
The following arguments are required:
.Dw Fl
.Di L
.Dp Ar file1
.Dp Ar file2
A pathname of a file to be joined.
If either of
the
.Ar file1
or
.Ar file2
arguments is
.Sq Fl
the standard
input is used in its place.
.Dp
.Pp
The
.Nm join
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm join
function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.

.Sh BUGS
The conventions of
.Nm
.Xr join 1 ,
.Xr comm 1 ,
.Xr sort 1 ,
.Xr uniq 1 ,
.Xr look 1
and
.Xr awk  1
are wildly incongruous.
