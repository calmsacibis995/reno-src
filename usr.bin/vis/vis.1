.SH NAME
vis \- display non-printable characters in a visual format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vis
[
.B \-nwctsobfl
] [
.B \-F
foldwidth
] [ file ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIVis\fP is a filter for converting non-printable characters
into a visual representation.  It differs from cat -v in that
the form is unique and invertible.  By default, all non-graphic
characters except space, tab, and newline are encoded.
A detailed description of the
various visual formats is given in vis(3).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -c
Request a format which displays a small subset of the
non-printable characters using C-style backslash sequences.
.IP -o
Request a format which displays non-printable characters as
an octal number, \\ddd.
.IP -t
Tabs are also encoded.
.IP -w
White space (space-tab-newline) is also encoded.
.IP -s
Only characters considered unsafe to send to a terminal are encoded.
This flag allows backspace, bell, and carriage return in addition
to the default space, tab and newline.
.IP -f
and
.IP -F
Causes
.B vis
to fold output lines to foldwidth columns (default 80), like fold(1), except
that a hidden newline sequence is used, (which is removed
when inverting the file back to its original form with unvis(1)).
If the last character in the encoded file does not end in a newline,
a hidden newline sequence is appended to the output.
This makes
the output usuable with various editors and other utilities which
typically don't work with partial lines.
.IP -n
Turns off any encoding, except for the fact that backslashes are
still doubled and hidden newline sequences inserted if -f or -F
is selected.  When combined with the -f flag, vis becomes like
an invertible version of the fold(1) utility.  That is, the output
can be unfolded by running the output through unvis(1).
.IP -b
Turns off prepending of backslash before up-arrow control sequences
and Meta characters, and disables the doubling of backslashes.  This
produces output which is neither invertible or precise, but does
represent a minimum of change to the input.  It is similar to cat -v.
.IP -l
Mark newlines with the visable sequence '\\$', followed by the newline.
