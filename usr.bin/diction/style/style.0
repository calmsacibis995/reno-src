     _S_t_y_l_e analyzes the surface characteristics of the writing
     style of a document.  It reports on readability, sentence
     length and structure, word length and usage, verb type, and
     sentence openers.	Because _s_t_y_l_e runs _d_e_r_o_f_f before looking
     at the text, formatting header files should be included as
     part of the input.  The default macro package --mmss may be
     overridden with the flag --mmmm.. The flag --mmll, which causes
     ddeerrooffff to skip lists, should be used if the document con-
     tains many lists of non-sentences.  The other options are
     used to locate sentences with certain characteristics.

     --aa   print all sentences with their length and readability
	  index.

     --ee   print all sentences that begin with an expletive.

     --pp   print all sentences that contain a passive verb.

     --ll_n_u_m
	  print all sentences longer than _n_u_m.

     --rr_n_u_m
	  print all sentences whose readability index is greater
	  than _n_u_m.

     --PP   print parts of speech of the words in the document.

     Use of non-standard formatting macros may cause incorrect
     sentence breaks.
