.Sh NAME
.Nm mset
.Nd retrieve ASCII to IBM 3270 keyboard map
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mset
.Op Fl picky
.Op Fl shell
.Op Ar keyboardname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mset
retrieves mapping information
for the ASCII keyboard to IBM 3270 terminal
special functions.
Normally, these mappings are found
in
.Pa /usr/share/misc/map3270
(see
.Xr map3270  5  ) .
This information is used by the
.Xr tn3270
command (see
.Xr tn3270  1  ) .
.Pp
The default
.Nm mset
output can be used to store the mapping information in the process environment
in order to avoid scanning
.Nm map3270
each time
.Nm tn3270
is invoked.
To do this, place the following command in your
.Pa .login
file:
.Pp
.Dl set noglob; setenv MAP3270 "\(gamset\(ga"; unset noglob
.Pp
If the
.Ar keyboardname
argument is not supplied,
.Nm mset
attempts to determine the name of the keyboard the user is using,
by checking the
.Ev KEYBD
environment variable.
If the
.Ev KEYBD
environment variable is not set, then
.Nm mset
uses the user's terminal type from the environment variable
.Ev TERM
as the keyboard name.
Normally,
.Nm mset
then uses the file
.Xr map3270 5
to find the keyboard mapping for that terminal.
However, if the environment variable
.Ev MAP3270
exists and contains the entry for the specified keyboard, then that
definition is used.
If the value of
.Ev MAP3270
begins with a slash (`/') then it is assumed to be the full pathname
of an alternate mapping file and that file is searched first.
In any case, if the mapping for the keyboard is not found in
the environment, nor in an alternate map file, nor in the standard map file,
then the same search is performed for an entry for a keyboard with the name
.Ar unknown  .
If that search also fails,
then a default mapping
is used.
.Pp
The arguments to
.Nm mset
are:
.Pp
.Tw Fl
.Tp Fl picky
When processing the various
.Pa map3270
entries (for the user's keyboard,
and all those encountered before the one for the user's keyboard),
.Nm mset
normally will not complain about entries for unknown functions (like
.Dq PFX1 ;
the
.Fl picky
argument causes
.Nm mset
to issue warning messages about these unknown entries.
.Tp Fl shell
If the
.Pa map3270
entry is longer than the shell's 1024 environmental variable
length limit, the default
.Nm mset
output cannot be used to store the mapping information in the process
environment to avoid scanning
.Pa map3270
each time
.Nm tn3270
is invoked.
The
.Fl shell
argument causes
.Nm mset
to generate shell commands to set the environmental variables
.Ev MAP3270  ,
.Ev MAP3270A ,
and so on, breaking up the entry to fit within the shell environmental
variable length limit.
To set these variables, place the following command in your
.Pa .login
file:
.Pp
.Dl mset -shell > tmp ; source tmp ; /bin/rm tmp
.Tp Ar keyboardname
When searching for the
.Pa map3270
entry that matches the user's keyboard,
.Nm mset
will use
.Ar keyboardname
instead of determining the keyboard name from the
.Ev KEYBD
or
.Ev TERM
environmental variables.
