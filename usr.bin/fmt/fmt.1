.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Fmt
is a simple text formatter which reads the concatenation of input
files (or standard input if none are given) and produces on standard
output a version of its input with lines as close to the
.Ar goal
length
as possible without exceeding the maximum.  The
.Ar goal
length defaults
to 65 and the maximum to 75.  The spacing at the beginning of the
input lines is preserved in the output, as are blank lines and
interword spacing.
.Pp
.Nm Fmt
is meant to format mail messages prior to sending, but may also be useful
for other simple tasks.
For instance,
within visual mode of the
.Xr ex 1
editor (e.g.
.Xr vi 1 )
the command
.Pp
.Dl \&!}fmt
.Pp
will reformat a paragraph,
evening the lines.

operations, the standard text processors are likely to be more appropriate.
