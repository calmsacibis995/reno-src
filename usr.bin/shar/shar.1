.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Shar
writes an
.IR sh (1)
shell script to the standard output which will recreate the file
hierarchy specified by the command line operands.
Directories will be recreated and must be specified before the
files they contain.
.PP
.I Shar
is normally used for distributing small numbers of files by
.IR ftp (1)
or
.IR mail (1).
.SH SEE ALSO
compress(1), mail(1), uuencode(1), tar(1)
.SH BUGS
.I Shar
makes no provisions for special types of files or files containing
magic characters.
.PP
It is easy to insert trojan horses into
.I shar
files.
It is strongly recommended that all shell archive files be examined
before running them through
.IR sh (1).
Archives produced using this implementation of
.I shar
may be easily examined with the command:
.sp
.RS
grep -v '^X' program.shar
.RE

.IR ls (1)
and mail it to Rick:

cd ls
.br
shar `find . -print` | mail -s "ls source" rick

To recreate the program directory:
.sp
