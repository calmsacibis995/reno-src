The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred
in 1972 on the 3rd of September.
By this time, most countries had recognized the reformation (although
a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.)
Ten days following that date were eliminated by
the reformation, so the calendar for that month is a bit unusual.
