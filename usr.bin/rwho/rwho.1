.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

but for all machines on the local network.
If no report has been
received from a machine for 5 minutes then
.Nm rwho
assumes the machine is down, and does not report users last known
to be logged into that machine.
.Pp
If a users hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more, then
.Nm rwho
reports this idle time.  If a user hasn't typed to the system for
an hour or more, then
the user will be omitted from the output of
.Nm rwho
unless the
.Fl a
flag is given.
