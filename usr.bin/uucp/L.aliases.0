     L.aliases - UUCP hostname alias file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _L._a_l_i_a_s_e_s file defines mapping (aliasing) of system
     names for uucp.  This is intended for compensating for sys-
     tems that have changed names, or do not provide their entire
     machine name (like most USG systems). It is also useful when
     a machine's name is not obvious or commonly misspelled.

     Each line in _L._a_l_i_a_s_e_s is of the form:

	  real_name alias_name

     Any amount of whitespace may separate the two items.  Lines
     beginning with a `#' character are comments.

     All occurrences of _a_l_i_a_s__n_a_m_e are mapped to _r_e_a_l__n_a_m_e by
     _u_u_c_i_c_o(8C), _u_u_c_p(1), and _u_u_x(1).  The mapping occurs regard-
     less of whether the name was typed in by a user or provided
     by a remote site. An exception is the --ss option of _u_u_c_i_c_o;
     only the site's real hostname (the name in _L._s_y_s(5)) will be
     accepted there.

     Aliased system names should not be placed in _L._s_y_s; they
     will not be used.
