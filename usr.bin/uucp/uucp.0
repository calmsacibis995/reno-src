     _U_u_c_p copies files named by the source-file arguments to the
     destination-file argument.  A file name may be a pathname on
     your machine, or may have the form

	  system-name!pathname

     where `system-name' is taken from a list of system names
     that _u_u_c_p knows about.  Shell metacharacters ?*[] appearing
     in the pathname part will be expanded on the appropriate
     system.

     Pathnames may be one of:

     (1)  a full pathname;

     (2)  a pathname preceded by ~~_u_s_e_r; where _u_s_e_r is a userid on
	  the specified system and is replaced by that user's
	  login directory;

     (3)  a pathname prefixed by ~~, where ~~ is expanded into the
	  system's public directory (usually
	  /var/spool/uucppublic);

     (4)  a partial pathname, which is prefixed by the current
	  directory.

     If the result is an erroneous pathname for the remote sys-
     tem, the copy will fail.  If the destination-file is a
     directory, the last part of the source-file name is used.

     _U_u_c_p preserves execute permissions across the transmission
     and gives 0666 read and write permissions (see _c_h_m_o_d(2)).

     The following options are interpreted by _u_u_c_p.

     --aa   Avoid doing a _g_e_t_w_d to find the current directory.
	  (This is sometimes used for efficiency.)

     --cc   Use the source file when copying out rather than copy-
	  ing the file to the spool directory.	(This is the
	  default.)

     --CC   Copy the source file to the spool directory and
	  transmit the copy.

     --dd   Make all necessary directories for the file copy.
	  (This is the default.)

     --ff   Do not make intermediate directories for the file copy.

     --gg_g_r_a_d_e
	  _G_r_a_d_e is a single letter/number; lower ASCII sequence
	  characters will cause a job to be transmitted earlier
	  during a particular conversation.  Default is `n'. By
	  way of comparison, _u_u_x(1) defaults to `A'; mail is usu-
	  ally sent at `C'.

     --mm   Send mail to the requester when the copy is complete.

     --nn_u_s_e_r
	  Notify _u_s_e_r on remote system (i.e., send _u_s_e_r mail)
	  that a file was sent.

     --rr   Do not start the transfer, just queue the job.

     --ss_s_p_o_o_l
	  Use _s_p_o_o_l as the spool directory instead of the
	  default.

     --xx_d_e_b_u_g
	  Turn on the debugging at level _d_e_b_u_g.

     The domain of remotely accessible files can (and for obvious
     security reasons, usually should) be severely restricted.
     You will very likely not be able to fetch files by pathname;
     ask a responsible person on the remote system to send them
     to you.  For the same reasons you will probably not be able
     to send files to arbitrary pathnames.

BBUUGGSS
     All files received by _u_u_c_p will be owned by the uucp
     administrator (usually UID 5).

     The --mm option will only work sending files or receiving a
     single file.  (Receiving multiple files specified by special
     shell characters ?*[] will not activate the --mm option.)

     At present _u_u_c_p cannot copy to a system several "hops" away,
     that is, a command of the form

	  uucp myfile system1!system2!system3!yourfile

     is not permitted. Use _u_u_s_e_n_d(1) instead.

     When invoking _u_u_c_p from _c_s_h(1), the `!' character must be
     prefixed by the `\' escape to inhibit _c_s_h's history mechan-
     ism. (Quotes are not sufficient.)

     _U_u_c_p refuses to copy a file that does not give read access
     to ``other''; that is, the file must have at least 0444
     modes.
