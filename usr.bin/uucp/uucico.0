     _U_u_c_i_c_o performs the actual work involved in transferring
     files between systems. _U_u_c_p(1) and _u_u_x(1) merely queue
     requests for data transfer which _u_u_c_i_c_o processes.

     The following options are available.

     --dd_s_p_o_o_l_d_i_r
	     Use _s_p_o_o_l_d_i_r as the spool directory. The default is
	     /var/spool/uucp.

     --gg_g_r_a_d_e Only send jobs of grade _g_r_a_d_e or higher this
	     transfer.	The grade of a job is specified when the
	     job is queued by _u_u_c_p or _u_u_x.

     --rr_r_o_l_e  _r_o_l_e is either 1 or 0; it indicates whether _u_u_c_i_c_o
	     is to start up in master or slave role, respec-
	     tively. 1 is used when running _u_u_c_i_c_o by hand or
	     from _c_r_o_n(8).  0 is used when another system calls
	     the local system.	Slave role is the default.

     --RR      Reverse roles.  When used with the --rr11 option, this
	     tells the remote system to begin sending its jobs
	     first, instead of waiting for the local machine to
	     finish.

     --ss_s_y_s_t_e_m
	     Call only system _s_y_s_t_e_m.  If --ss is not specified,
	     and -r1 is specified, _u_u_c_i_c_o will attempt to call
	     all systems for which there is work.  If --ss is
	     specified, a call will be made even if there is no
	     work for that system. This is useful for polling.

     --xx_d_e_b_u_g Turn on debugging at level _d_e_b_u_g.	Level 5 is a good
	     start when trying to find out why a call failed.
	     Level 9 is very detailed. Level 99 is absurdly ver-
	     bose.  If _r_o_l_e is 1 (master), output is normally
	     written to the standard message output _s_t_d_e_r_r.  If
	     _s_t_d_e_r_r is unavailable, output is written to
	     /var/spool/uucp/AUDIT/_s_y_s_t_e_m.  When _r_o_l_e is 0
	     (slave), debugging output is always written to the
	     AUDIT file.

     --LL      Only call ``local'' sites. A site is considered
	     local if the device-type field in _L._s_y_s is one of
	     LOCAL, DIR or TCP.

     --tt_t_u_r_n_a_r_o_u_n_d
	     Use _t_u_r_n_a_r_o_u_n_d as the line turnaround time (in
	     minutes) instead of the default 30.  If _t_u_r_n_a_r_o_u_n_d
	     is missing or 0, line turnaround will be disabled.
	     After _u_u_c_i_c_o has been running in slave role for _t_u_r_-
	     _n_a_r_o_u_n_d minutes, it will attempt to run in master
	     role by negotiating with the remote machine.  In
	     earlier versions of _u_u_c_i_c_o, a transfer of many large
	     files in one direction would hold up mail going in
	     the other direction.  With the turnaround code work-
	     ing, the message flow will be more bidirectional in
	     the short term.  This option only works with newer
	     _u_u_c_i_c_o's and is ignored by older ones.

     If _u_u_c_i_c_o receives a SSIIGGFFPPEE (see _k_i_l_l(1)), it will toggle
     the debugging on or off.

     _U_u_c_p_d is the server for supporting uucp connections over
     networks.	_U_u_c_p_d listens for service requests at the port
     indicated in the ``uucp'' service specification; see _s_e_r_-
     _v_i_c_e_s(5).	The server provides login name and password
     authentication before starting up _u_u_c_i_c_o for the rest of the
     transaction.

     _U_u_c_i_c_o is commonly used either of two ways: as a daemon run
     periodically by _c_r_o_n(8) to call out to remote systems, and
     as a ``shell'' for remote systems who call in.  For calling
     out periodically, a typical line in _c_r_o_n_t_a_b would be:

	  0    *    *	 *    *    /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1

     This will run _u_u_c_i_c_o every hour in master role. For each
     system that has transfer requests queued, _u_u_c_i_c_o calls the
     system, logs in, and executes the transfers. The file
     _L._s_y_s(5) is consulted for information about how to log in,
     while _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s(5) specifies available lines and modems for
     calling.

     For remote systems to dial in, an entry in the _p_a_s_s_w_d(5)
     file must be created, with a login ``shell'' of _u_u_c_i_c_o.  For
     example:

	  nuucp:Password:6:1::/var/spool/uucppublic:/usr/lib/uucp/uucico

     The UID for UUCP remote logins is not critical, so long as
     it differs from the UUCP Administrative login.  The latter
     owns the UUCP files, and assigning this UID to a remote
     login would be an extreme security hazard.
