     _U_u_q is used to examine (and possibly delete) entries in the
     uucp queue.

     When listing jobs, _u_u_q uses a format reminiscent of _l_s.  For
     the long format, information for each job listed includes
     job number, number of files to transfer, user who spooled
     the job, number of bytes to send, type of command requested
     (S for sending files, R for receiving files, X for remote
     uucp), and file or command desired.

     Several options are available:

     --hh        Print only the summary lines for each system.
	       Summary lines give system name, number of jobs for
	       the system, and total number of bytes to send.

     --ll        Specifies a long format listing.  The default is
	       to list only the job numbers sorted across the
	       page.

     --ss_s_y_s_t_e_m  Limit output to jobs for systems whose system
	       names begin with _s_y_s_t_e_m.

     --uu_u_s_e_r    Limit output to jobs for users whose login names
	       begin with _u_s_e_r.

     --dd_j_o_b_n_o   Delete job number _j_o_b_n_o (as obtained from a previ-
	       ous _u_u_q command) from the uucp queue.  Only the
	       UUCP Administrator is permitted to delete jobs.

     --rr_s_d_i_r    Look for files in the spooling directory _s_d_i_r
	       instead of the default directory.

     --bb_b_a_u_d    Use _b_a_u_d to compute the transfer time instead of
	       the default 1200 baud.

BBUUGGSS
     No information is available on work requested by the remote
     machine.

     The user who requests a remote uucp command is unknown.

     UUuuqq --ll can be horrendously slow.
