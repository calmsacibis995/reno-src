     _U_u_s_e_n_d sends a file to a given location on a remote system.
     The system need not be directly connected to the local sys-
     tem, but a chain of _u_u_c_p(1) links needs to connect the two
     systems.

     If the --mm option is specified, the mode of the file on the
     remote end will be taken from the octal number given.  Oth-
     erwise, the mode of the input file will be used.

     The sourcefile can be ``-'', meaning to use the standard
     input.  Both of these options are primarily intended for
     internal use of _u_u_s_e_n_d.

     The remotefile can include the ~userid syntax.

     If anything goes wrong any further away than the first sys-
     tem down the line, you will never hear about it.

     This command should not exist, since _u_u_c_p should handle it.

     All systems along the line must have the _u_u_s_e_n_d command
     available and allow remote execution of it.

     Some uucp systems have a bug where binary files cannot be
     the input to a _u_u_x command.  If this bug exists in any sys-
     tem along the line, the file will show up severly munged.
