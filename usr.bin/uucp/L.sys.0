     L.sys - UUCP remote host description file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _L._s_y_s file is consulted by the UUCP daemon _u_u_c_i_c_o(8C)
     for information on remote systems.  _L._s_y_s includes the sys-
     tem name, appropriate times to call, phone numbers, and a
     login and password for the remote system.	_L._s_y_s is thus a
     privileged file, owned by the UUCP Administrator; it is
     accessible only to the Administrator and to the superuser.

     Each line in _L._s_y_s describes one connection to one remote
     host, and has the form:

     System  Times  Caller  Class  Device/Phone_Number	[Expect  Send]....

     Fields can be separated by any number of blanks or tabs.
     Lines beginning with a `#' character are comments; long
     lines can be continued by appending a `\' character to the
     end of the line.

     The first five fields (_S_y_s_t_e_m through _D_e_v_i_c_e/_P_h_o_n_e__N_u_m_b_e_r)
     specify the hardware mechanism that is necessary to make a
     connection to a remote host, such as a modem or network.
     _U_u_c_i_c_o searches from the top down through _L._s_y_s to find the
     desired _S_y_s_t_e_m; it then opens the _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s(5) file and
     searches for the first available device with the same
     _C_a_l_l_e_r, _C_l_a_s_s, and (possibly) _D_e_v_i_c_e.  (``Available'' means
     that the device is ready and not being used for something
     else.) _U_u_c_i_c_o attempts a connection using that device; if
     the connection cannot be made (for example, a dialer gets a
     busy signal), _u_u_c_i_c_o tries the next available device. If
     this also fails, it returns to _L._s_y_s to look for another
     line for the same _S_y_s_t_e_m.	If none is found, _u_u_c_i_c_o gives
     up.

     _S_y_s_t_e_m is the hostname of the remote system.  Every machine
     with which this system communicates via UUCP should be
     listed, regardless of who calls whom.  Systems not listed in
     _L._s_y_s will not be permitted a connection.	The local host-
     name should nnoott appear here for security reasons.

     _T_i_m_e_s is a comma-separated list of the times of the day and
     week that calls are permitted to this _S_y_s_t_e_m.  _T_i_m_e_s is most
     commonly used to restrict long distance telephone calls to
     those times when rates are lower.	List items are con-
     structed as:

	  _k_e_y_w_o_r_dhhmm--hhmm//_g_r_a_d_e;;_r_e_t_r_y__t_i_m_e

     _K_e_y_w_o_r_d is required, and must be one of:

     WWkk      Any weekday. In addition, MMoo, TTuu, WWee, TThh, FFrr, SSaa,
	     and SSuu can be used for Monday through Sunday,
	     respectively.

     EEvveenniinngg When evening telephone rates are in effect, from
	     1700 to 0800 Monday through Friday, and all day
	     Saturday and Sunday.  EEvveenniinngg is the same as

	     day, and from 2300 to 1700 Sunday.  NNiigghhtt is the

     NNoonnPPeeaakk This is a slight modification of EEvveenniinngg.	It
	     matches when the USA X.25 carriers have their lower
	     rate period. This is 1800 to 0700 Monday through
	     Friday, and all day Saturday and Sunday.  NNoonnPPeeaakk is
	     the same as AAnnyy11880000--00770000,,SSaa,,SSuu.

     NNeevveerr   Never call; calling into this _S_y_s_t_e_m is forbidden or
	     impossible.  This is intended for polled connec-
	     tions, where the remote system calls into the local
	     machine periodically.  This is necessary when one of
	     the machines is lacking either dial-in or dial-out
	     modems.

     The optional _h_h_m_m-_h_h_m_m subfield provides a time range that
     modifies the keyword.  _h_h_m_m refers to _h_o_u_r_s and _m_i_n_u_t_e_s in
     24-hour time (from 0000 to 2359).	The time range is permit-
     ted to "wrap" around midnight, and will behave in the obvi-
     ous way. It is invalid to follow the EEvveenniinngg, NNoonnPPeeaakk, and
     NNiigghhtt keywords with a time range.

     The _g_r_a_d_e subfield is optional; if present, it is composed
     of a `/' (slash) and single character denoting the _g_r_a_d_e of
     the connection, from 00 to 99, AA to ZZ, or aa to zz.  This speci-
     fies that only requests of grade _g_r_a_d_e or better will be
     transferred during this time.  (The grade of a request or
     job is specified when it is queued by _u_u_c_p or _u_u_x.) By con-
     vention, mail is sent at grade CC, news is sent at grade dd,
     and uucp copies are sent at grade nn.  Unfortunately, some
     sites do not follow these conventions, so it is not 100%
     reliable.

     The _r_e_t_r_y__t_i_m_e subfield is optional; it must be preceded by
     a `;' (semicolon) and specifies the time, in minutes, before
     a failed connection may be tried again.  (This restriction
     is in addition to any constraints imposed by the rest of the
     _T_i_m_e field.) By default, the retry time starts at 10 minutes



Printed 7/4/90		      April				2






L.SYS(5)		      1986			 L.SYS(5)



     and gradually increases at each failure, until after 26
     tries _u_u_c_i_c_o gives up completely (MAX RETRIES). If the retry
     time is too small, _u_u_c_i_c_o may run into MAX RETRIES too soon.

     _C_a_l_l_e_r is the type of device used:

     AACCUU     Automatic call unit or auto-dialing modem such as
	     the Hayes Smartmodem 1200 or Novation ``Smart Cat''.
	     See _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s for a list of supported modems.

     DDIIRR     Direct connect; hardwired line (usually RS-232) to a
	     remote system.

     MMIICCOOMM   Micom Terminal Switch.

     PPAADD     X.25 PAD connection.

     PPCCPP     GTE Telenet PC Pursuit. See _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s for configura-
	     tion  details.

     SSYYTTEEKK   Sytek high-speed dedicated modem port connection.

     TTCCPP     Berkeley TCP/IP or 3Com UNET connection. These are
	     mutually exclusive.  TCP ports do nnoott need entries
	     in _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s since all the necessary information is
	     contained in _L._s_y_s.  If several alternate ports or
	     network connections should be tried, use multiple
	     _L._s_y_s entries.

     _C_l_a_s_s is usually the speed (baud) of the device, typically
     300, 1200, or 2400 for ACU devices and 9600 for direct
     lines.  Valid values are device dependent, and are specified
     in the _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s file.

     On some devices, the baud may be preceded by a non-numeric
     prefix.  This is used in _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s to distinguish among dev-
     ices that have identical _C_a_l_l_e_r and baud, but yet are dis-
     tinctly different. For example, 1200 could refer to all Bell
     212-compatible modems, V1200 to Racal-Vadic modems, and
     C1200 to CCITT modems, all at 1200 baud.

     On TCP connections, _C_l_a_s_s is the port number (an integer
     number) or a port name from /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s that is used to
     make the connection. For standard Berkeley TCP/IP, UUCP nor-
     mally uses port number 540.

     _D_e_v_i_c_e/_P_h_o_n_e__N_u_m_b_e_r varies based on the _C_a_l_l_e_r field.  For
     ACU devices, this is the phone number to dial.  The number
     may include: digits 00 through 99; ## and ** for dialing those
     symbols on tone telephone lines; -- (hyphen) to pause for a
     moment, typically two to four seconds; == (equal sign) to
     wait for a second dial tone (implemented as a pause on many

     modems). Other characters are modem dependent; generally
     standard telephone punctuation characters (such as the slash
     and parentheses) are ignored, although _u_u_c_i_c_o does not
     guarantee this.

     The phone number can be preceded by an alphabetic string;
     the string is indexed and converted through the
     _L-_d_i_a_l_c_o_d_e_s(5) file.

     For DIR devices, the _D_e_v_i_c_e/_P_h_o_n_e__N_u_m_b_e_r field contains the
     name of the device in /_d_e_v that is used to make the connec-
     tion. There must be a corresponding line in _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s with
     identical _C_a_l_l_e_r, _C_l_a_s_s, and _D_e_v_i_c_e fields.

     For TCP and other network devices, _D_e_v_i_c_e/_P_h_o_n_e__N_u_m_b_e_r holds
     the true network name of the remote system, which may be
     different from its UUCP name (although one would hope not).

     _E_x_p_e_c_t and _S_e_n_d refer to an arbitrarily long set of strings
     that alternately specify what to _e_x_p_e_c_t and what to _s_e_n_d to
     login to the remote system once a physical connection has
     been established.	A complete set of expect/send strings is
     referred to as an _e_x_p_e_c_t/_s_e_n_d _s_c_r_i_p_t.  The same syntax is
     used in the _L-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s file to interact with the dialer prior
     to making a connection; there it is referred to as a _c_h_a_t
     _s_c_r_i_p_t.  The complete format for one _e_x_p_e_c_t/_s_e_n_d pair is:

	  _e_x_p_e_c_t--_t_i_m_e_o_u_t--_s_e_n_d--_e_x_p_e_c_t--_t_i_m_e_o_u_t   _s_e_n_d

     _E_x_p_e_c_t and _S_e_n_d are character strings.  _E_x_p_e_c_t is compared
     against incoming text from the remote host; _s_e_n_d is sent
     back when _e_x_p_e_c_t is matched.  By default, the _s_e_n_d is fol-
     lowed by a `\r' (carriage return). If the _e_x_p_e_c_t string is
     not matched within _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds (default 45), then it is
     assumed that the match failed.  The `_e_x_p_e_c_t--_s_e_n_d--_e_x_p_e_c_t'
     notation provides a limited loop mechanism; if the first
     _e_x_p_e_c_t string fails to match, then the _s_e_n_d string between
     the hyphens is transmitted, and _u_u_c_i_c_o waits for the second
     _e_x_p_e_c_t string. This can be repeated indefinitely. When the
     last _e_x_p_e_c_t string fails, _u_u_c_i_c_o hangs up and logs that the
     connection failed.

     The timeout can (optionally) be specified by appending the
     parameter `~~_n_n' to the expect string, when _n_n is the timeout
     time in seconds.

     Backslash escapes that may be imbedded in the _e_x_p_e_c_t or _s_e_n_d
     strings include:

	  \b	  Generate a 3/10 second BREAK.
	  \b_n	  Where _n is a single-digit number;
		  generate an _n/10 second BREAK.



Printed 7/4/90		      April				4






L.SYS(5)		      1986			 L.SYS(5)



	  \c	  Suppress the \r at the end of a _s_e_n_d string.
	  \d	  Delay; pause for 1 second. (_S_e_n_d only.)
	  \r	  Carriage Return.
	  \s	  Space.
	  \n	  Newline.
	  \xxx	  Where _x_x_x is an octal constant;
		  denotes the corresponding ASCII character.

     As a special case, an empty pair of double-quotes """" in the
     _e_x_p_e_c_t string is interpreted as ``expect nothing''; that is,
     transmit the _s_e_n_d string regardless of what is received.
     Empty double-quotes in the _s_e_n_d string cause a lone `\r'
     (carriage return) to be sent.

     One of the following keywords may be substituted for the
     _s_e_n_d string:

	  BREAK   Generate a 3/10 second BREAK
	  BREAK_n  Generate an _n/10 second BREAK
	  CR	  Send a Carriage Return (same as "").
	  EOT	  Send an End-Of-Transmission character, ASCII \004.
		  Note that this will cause most hosts to hang up.
	  NL	  Send a Newline.
	  PAUSE   Pause for 3 seconds.
	  PAUSE_n  Pause for _n seconds.
	  P_ODD   Use odd parity on future send strings.
	  P_ONE   Use parity one on future send strings.
	  P_EVEN  Use even parity on future send strings. (Default)
	  P_ZERO  Use parity zero on future send strings.

     Finally, if the _e_x_p_e_c_t string consists of the keyword AABBOORRTT,
     then the string following is used to arm an abort trap. If
     that string is subsequently received any time prior to the
     completion of the entire _e_x_p_e_c_t/_s_e_n_d script, then _u_u_c_i_c_o
     will abort, just as if the script had timed out. This is
     useful for trapping error messages from port selectors or
     front-end processors such as ``Host Unavailable'' or ``Sys-
     tem is Down.''

     For example:

	  ""  ""  ogin:--ogin:	nuucp  ssword:	ufeedme

     This is executed as, ``When the remote system answers,
     _e_x_p_e_c_t nothing.  _S_e_n_d a carriage return.  _E_x_p_e_c_t the remote
     to transmit the string `ogin:'. If it doesn't within 45
     seconds, send another carriage return.  When it finally
     does, _s_e_n_d it the string `nuucp'.	Then _e_x_p_e_c_t the string
     `ssword:'; when that is received, _s_e_n_d `ufeedme'.''

     ``ABORT'' in the send/expect script is expressed ``back-
     wards,'' that is, it should be written `` _e_x_p_e_c_t AABBOORRTT'' but
     instead it is `` AABBOORRTT _e_x_p_e_c_t''.

     Several of the backslash escapes in the send/expect strings
     are confusing and/or different from those used by AT&T and
     Honey-Danber UUCP.  For example, `\b' requests a BREAK,
     while practically everywhere else `\b' means backspace.
     `\t' for tab and `\f' for formfeed are not implemented.
     `\s' is a kludge; it would be more sensible to be able to
     delimit strings with quotation marks.
