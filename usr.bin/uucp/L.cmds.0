     L.cmds - UUCP remote command permissions file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _L._c_m_d_s file contains a list of commands, one per line,
     that are permitted for remote execution via _u_u_x(1C).

     The default search path is /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb. To change
     the path, include anywhere in the file a line of the form:

	  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb

     Normally, an acknowledgment is mailed back to the requesting
     site after the command completes. If a command name is suf-
     fixed with ,,EErrrroorr, then an acknowledgment will be mailed
     only if the command fails.  If the command is suffixed with
     ,,NNoo, then no acknowledgment will ever be sent. (These
     correspond with the --zz and --nn options of _u_u_x, respectively.)

     For most sites, _L._c_m_d_s should only include the lines:

	  rmail
	  ruusend

     News sites should add:

	  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/new
	  rnews,Error

     While file names supplied as arguments to _u_u_x commands will
     be checked against the list of accessible directory trees in
     _U_S_E_R_F_I_L_E(5), this check can be easily circumvented and
     should not be depended upon.  In other words, it is unwise
     to include any commands in _L._c_m_d_s that accept local file
     names. In particular, _s_h(1) and _c_s_h(1) are extreme risks.

     It is common (but hazardous) to include _u_u_c_p(1C) in _L._c_m_d_s;
     see the NOTES section of _U_S_E_R_F_I_L_E.
