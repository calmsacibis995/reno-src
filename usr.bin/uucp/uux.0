     _U_u_x will gather zero or more files from various systems,
     execute a command on a specified system and then send stan-
     dard output to a file on a specified system.

     The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_s_t_r_i_n_g is made up of one or more arguments that
     look like a Shell command line, except that the command and
     file names may be prefixed by _s_y_s_t_e_m-_n_a_m_e!!.  A null _s_y_s_t_e_m-
     _n_a_m_e is interpreted as the local system.

     File names may be one of

	  (1) a full path name;

	  (2) a path name preceded by ~~_u_s_e_r where _u_s_e_r is a login
	  name on the specified system and is replaced by that
	  user's login directory;

	  (3) a path name prefixed by ~~;; where ~~ is expanded to
	  the system's public directory (usually
	  /var/spool/uucppublic);

	  (4) a partial pathname, which is prefixed by the
	  current directory.

     As an example, the command

	  uux "!diff usg!/usr/dan/file1 pwba!/a4/dan/file2 >
	  !~/dan/file.diff"

     will get the ffiillee11 and ffiillee22 files from the ``usg'' and
     ``pwba'' machines, execute a _d_i_f_f(1) command and put the
     results in ffiillee..ddiiffff in the local /var/spool/uucppublic/dan/
     directory.

     Any special shell characters, such as <<>>;;||, should be quoted
     either by quoting the entire _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_s_t_r_i_n_g, or quoting the
     special characters as individual arguments.

     _U_u_x will attempt to get all files to the execution system.
     For files that are output files, the file name must be
     escaped using parentheses.  For example, the command

	  uux a!wc b!/usr/file1 \(c!/usr/file2 \)

     get //uussrr//ffiillee11 from system ``b'' and send it to system
     ``a'', perform a _w_c command on that file and send the result
     of the _w_c command to system ``c''.

     _U_u_x will notify you by mail if the requested command on the
     remote system was disallowed.  This notification can be
     turned off by the --nn option.

     The following _o_p_t_i_o_n_s are interpreted by _u_u_x:

     --	  The standard input to _u_u_x is made the standard input to
	  the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_s_t_r_i_n_g.

     --aa_n_a_m_e
	  Use _n_a_m_e as the user identification replacing the ini-
	  tiator user-id.

     --cc   Do not copy local file to the spool directory for
	  transfer to the remote machine (this is the default).

     --CC   Force the copy of local files to the spool directory
	  for transfer.

     --gg_g_r_a_d_e
	  _G_r_a_d_e is a single letter/number, from 00 to 99, AA to ZZ,
	  or aa to zz; 00 is the highest, and zz is the lowest grade.
	  The default is AA; by comparison _u_u_c_p(1) defaults to nn
	  and mail is usually sent at grade CC.	Lower grades
	  should be specified for high-volume jobs, such as news.

     --ll   Try and make a link from the original file to the spool
	  directory.  If the link cannot be made, copy the file.

     --nn   Do not notify the user when the command completes.

     --pp   Same as -: The standard input to _u_u_x is made the stan-
	  dard input to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_s_t_r_i_n_g.

     --rr   Do not start the file transfer, just queue the job.

     --xx_d_e_b_u_g
	  Produce debugging output on stdout.  The debug is a
	  number between 0 and 9; higher numbers give more
	  detailed information. Debugging is permitted only for
	  privileged users (specifically, those with read access
	  to _L._s_y_s(5).

     --zz   Notify the user only if the command fails.

     --LL   Start up _u_u_c_i_c_o with the --LL flag. This will force calls
	  to be made to local sites only (see _u_u_c_i_c_o(8)).

     For security reasons, many installations will limit the list
     of commands executable on behalf of an incoming request from
     _u_u_x.  Many sites will permit little more than the receipt of
     mail (see _m_a_i_l(1)) via _u_u_x.

BBUUGGSS
     Only the first command of a shell pipeline may have a
     _s_y_s_t_e_m-_n_a_m_e!!.  All other commands are executed on the system
     of the first command.

     The use of the shell metacharacter ** will probably not do
     what you want it to do.

     The shell tokens <<<< and >>>> are not implemented.

     When invoking _u_u_x from _c_s_h(1), the `!' character must be
     prefixed by the `\' escape to inhibit _c_s_h's history mechan-
     ism. (Quotes are not sufficient.)
