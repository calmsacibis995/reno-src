A symbolic link
.I name2
is created to
.IR name1
(\fIname2\fP is the name of the
file created, \fIname1\fP is the string
used in creating the symbolic link).
Either name may be an arbitrary path name; the files need not
be on the same file system.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, a zero value is returned.
If an error occurs, the error code is stored in \fIerrno\fP
and a \-1 value is returned.
