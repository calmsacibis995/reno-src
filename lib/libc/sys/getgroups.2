ngroups = getgroups(gidsetlen, gidset)
int ngroups, gidsetlen, *gidset;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getgroups
gets the current group access list of the user process
and stores it in the array 
.IR gidset .
The parameter
.I gidsetlen
indicates the number of entries that may be placed in 
.IR gidset.

.IR gidset .
No more than NGROUPS, as defined in
.RI < sys/param.h >,
will ever
be returned.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
A successful call returns the number of groups in the group set.
A value of \-1 indicates that an error occurred, and the error
code is stored in the global variable \fIerrno\fP\|.

is smaller than the number of groups in the group set.
