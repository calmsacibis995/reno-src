.SH NAME
swapon \- add a swap device for interleaved paging/swapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B swapon(special)
.B char *special;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Swapon
makes the block device 
.I special 
available to the system for
allocation for paging and swapping.  The names of potentially
available devices are known to the system and defined at system
configuration time.  The size of the swap area on 
.I special 
is calculated at the time the device is first made available
for swapping.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
If an error has occurred, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.

configured into the system as a swap device.
.TP 15

The major device number of 
.I special
is out of range (this indicates no device driver exists
for the associated hardware).
.TP 15
[EIO]
An I/O error occurred while opening the swap device.
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
.I Special
points outside the process's allocated address space.
