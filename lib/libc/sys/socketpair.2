.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I socketpair
call creates an unnamed pair of connected sockets in
the specified domain
.IR d ,
of the specified
.IR type ,
and using the optionally specified
.IR protocol .
The descriptors used in referencing the new sockets
are returned in
.IR sv [0]
and
.IR sv [1].
The two sockets are indistinguishable.
