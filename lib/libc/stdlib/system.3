ignoring SIGINT and SIGQUIT, and blocking SIGCHLD.

If
.I string
is a NULL pointer,
.I system
will return non-zero if the command interpreter
.IR sh (1)
is available, and zero if it is not.
.PP
.I System
returns the exit status of the shell, or \-1 if the
.IR wait (3)
for the shell failed.
A return status of 127 indicates that the execution of the shell
failed.
