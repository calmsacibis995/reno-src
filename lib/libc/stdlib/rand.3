.AT 3
.SH NAME
rand, srand \- bad random number generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
void
srand(seed)
unsigned int seed;

rand()
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft B
These interfaces are obsoleted by random(3).
.ft R
.PP
The
.I rand
function computes a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range
of 0 to
.I RAND_MAX
(as defined by the header file <stdlib.h>).
.PP
The
.I srand
function sets its argument as the seed for a new sequence of
pseudo-random numbers to be returned by
.IR rand .
These sequences are repeatable by calling
.I srand
with the same seed value.
.PP
If no seed value is provided, the functions are automatically
seeded with a value of 1.
.SH STANDARDS
.B Rand
and
.B srand
conform to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
.SH "SEE ALSO"
random(3)
