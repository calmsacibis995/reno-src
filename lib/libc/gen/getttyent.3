.SH NAME
getttyent, getttynam, setttyent, endttyent \- get ttys file entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <ttyent.h>
.PP
.B struct ttyent *getttyent()
.PP
.B struct ttyent *getttynam(name)
.B char *name;
.PP
.B setttyent()
.PP
.B endttyent()
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getttyent,
and
.I getttynam
each return a pointer to an object, with the following structure,
containing the broken-out fields of a line from the tty description
file.
.sp
.nf
struct ttyent {
	char	*ty_name;			/* terminal device name */
	char	*ty_getty;		/* command to execute */
	char	*ty_type;			/* terminal type */
#define	TTY_ON		0x01	/* enable logins */
#define	TTY_SECURE	0x02	/* allow uid of 0 to login */
	int	ty_status;		/* flag values */
	char	*ty_window;		/* command for window manager */
	char	*ty_comment;		/* comment field */
};
.fi
.PP
The fields are as follows:
.TP
ty_name
The name of the character-special file.
.TP
ty_getty
The name of the command invoked by
.IR init (8)
to initialize tty line characteristics.
.TP
ty_type
The name of the default terminal type connected to this tty line.
.TP
ty_status
A mask of bit fields which indicate various actions allowed on this
tty line.
The possible flags are as follows:
.IP
TTY_ON
.IP
Enables logins (i.e.,
.IR init (8)
will start the command referenced by
.I ty_getty
on this entry).
.IP
TTY_SECURE
.IP
Allow users with a uid of 0 to login on this terminal.
.TP
ty_window
The command to execute for a window system associated with the line.
.TP
ty_comment
Any trailing comment field, with any leading hash marks (``#'') or
whitespace removed.
.PP
If any of the fields pointing to character strings are unspecified,
they are returned as null pointers.
The field
.I ty_status
will be zero if no flag values are specified.
.PP
See
.IR ttys (5)
for a more complete discussion of the meaning and usage of the
fields.
.PP
.I Getttyent
reads the next line from the ttys file, opening the file if necessary.
.I Setttyent
rewinds the file if open, or opens the file if it is unopened.
.I Endttyent
closes any open files.
.PP
.I Getttynam
searches from the beginning of the file until a matching
.I name
is found
(or until EOF is encountered).
.SH FILES
/etc/ttys
.SH "SEE ALSO"
login(1), ttyslot(3), gettytab(5), termcap(5), ttys(5), getty(8), init(8)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The routines
.I getttyent
and
.I getttynam
return a null pointer on EOF or error.
.I Setttyent
and
.I endttyent
return 0 on failure and 1 on success.
.SH BUGS
All information is contained in a static area so it must be copied if
it is to be saved.
