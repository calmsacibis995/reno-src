.SH NAME
getmntinfo - get information about mounted file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mount.h>
.LP
.ft B
int getmntinfo(mntbufp, flags)
struct statfs **mntbufp;
int flags
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getmntinfo
returns an array of
.I statfs
structures describing each currently mounted file system (see
.IR statfs (2)).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On successful completion,
.I getmntinfo
returns a count of the number of elements in the array.
The pointer to the array is stored into
.IR mntbufp .
Otherwise, zero is returned and
.I mntbufp
is unmodified.
.PP
.I Getmntinfo
passes its
.I flags
parameter transparently to
.IR getfsstat (2).
.SH BUGS
All information is contained in a static area,
so it must be copied if it is to be saved.
.SH SEE ALSO
getfsstat(2), statfs(2), mount(2), mount(8)
