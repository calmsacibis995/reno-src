.SH NAME
fgets - get a line from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>

.B char *fgets(s, n, stream)
.B char *s;
.B int n;
.B FILE *stream;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I fgets
function reads at most one less than the number of characters specified
by
.I n
from the stream pointed to by
.I stream
into the array pointed to by
.IR s .
No additional characters are read after a new-line character
(which is retained) or after end-of-file.
A null character is written immediately after the last character
read into the array.
.PP
The
.I fgets
function returns
.I s
if successful.
If end-of-file is encountered and no characters have been read
into the array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and
a null pointer is returned.
If a read error occurs during the operation, the array contents
are indeterminate and a null pointer is returned.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
getc(3), ferror(3) fread(3), scanf(3)
.SH STANDARDS
The
.I fgets
function is ANSI C compatible.
