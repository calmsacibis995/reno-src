.Sh DESCRIPTION
Note: This is the old version 7 UNIX system mail program.  The default
.Nm mail
command is described in
.Xr Mail  1  .
.Pp
.Nm Mail
with no argument prints a user's mail, message-by-message,
in last-in, first-out order; the optional argument
.Ic +
displays the mail messages in first-in, first-out order.
For each message, it reads a line from the standard input
to direct disposition of the message.

.Pp
An interrupt normally terminates the
.Ar mail
command; the mail file is unchanged.  The optional argument
.Fl i
tells
.Ar mail
to continue after interrupts.
.Pp
When
.Ar persons
are named,
.Ar mail
takes the standard input up to an end-of-file (or a line with just `.')
and adds it to each
.Sf Ar person \'s
.Pa mail
file.  The message is preceded by the sender's name and a postmark.
Lines that look like postmarks are prepended with `>'.  A
.Ar person
is usually a user name recognized by
.Xr login  1  .
To denote a recipient on a remote system, prefix
.Ar person
by the system name and exclamation mark (see
.Xr uucp  1  ) .
.Pp
The
.Fl f
option causes the named file, for example,
.Pa mbox ,
to be printed as if it were the mail file.
.Pp
When a user logs in he is informed of the presence of mail.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Delivermail
appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix as the program
.Nm mail.
.Sh BUGS
Race conditions sometimes result in a failure to remove a lock file.
.Pp
Normally anybody can read your mail, unless it is sent by
.Xr xsend  1  .
An installation can overcome this by making
.Nm mail
a set-user-id command that owns the mail directory.
