     _L_i_s_z_t takes a file whose names ends in `.l' and compiles the
     FRANZ LISP code there leaving an object program on the file
     whose name is that of the source with `.o' substituted for
     `.l'.

     The following options are interpreted by _l_i_s_z_t.

     --ee   Evaluate the given form before compilation begins.

     --mm   Compile a MACLISP file, by changing the readtable to
	  conform to MACLISP syntax and including a macro-defined
	  compatibility package.

     --oo   Put the object code in the specified file, rather than
	  the default `.o' file.

     --pp   places profiling code at the beginning of each non-
	  local function.  If the lisp system is also created
	  with profiling in it, this allows function calling fre-
	  quency to be determined (see _p_r_o_f(1).)

     --qq   Only print warning and error messages.  Compilation
	  statistics and notes on correct but unusual constructs
	  will not be printed.

     --rr   place bootstrap code at the beginning of the object
	  file, which when the object file is executed will cause
	  a lisp system to be invoked and the object file fasl'ed
	  in.

     --uu   Compile a UCI-lispfile, by changing the readtable to
	  conform to UCI-Lisp syntax and including a macro-
	  defined compatibility package.

     --ww   Suppress warning diagnostics.

     --xx   Create a lisp cross reference file with the same name
	  as the source file but with  `.x' appended.  The pro-
	  gram _l_x_r_e_f(1) reads this file and creates a human read-
	  able cross reference listing.

     --CC   put comments in the assembler output of the compiler.
	  Useful for debugging the compiler.

     --QQ   Print compilation statistics and warn of strange

	  constructs.  This is the default.

     --SS   Compile the named program and leave the assembler-
	  language output on the corresponding file suffixed
	  `.s'.  This will also prevent the assembler language
	  file from being assembled.

     --TT   send the assembler output to standard output.

     If no source file is specified, then the compiler will run
     interactively.  You will find yourself talking to the
     _l_i_s_p(1) top-level command interpreter.  You can compile a
     file by using the function _l_i_s_z_t (an nlambda) with the same
     arguments as you use on the command line.	For example to
     compile `foo', a MACLISP file, you would use:

	  (liszt -m foo)

     Note that _l_i_s_z_t supplies the ``.l'' extension for you.
