     _L_x_r_e_f reads cross reference file(s) written by the lisp com-
     piler _l_i_s_z_t and prints a cross reference listing on the
     standard output.  _L_i_s_z_t will create a cross reference file
     during compilation when it is given the --xx switch.  Cross
     reference files usually end in `.x' and consequently _l_x_r_e_f
     will append a `.x' to the file names given if necessary.
     The first option to _l_x_r_e_f is a decimal integer, N, which
     sets the _i_g_n_o_r_e_l_e_v_e_l. If a function is called more than
     _i_g_n_o_r_e_l_e_v_e_l times, the cross reference listing will just
     print the number of calls instead of listing each one of
     them.  The default for _i_g_n_o_r_e_l_e_v_e_l is 50.

     The --aa option causes _l_x_r_e_f to put limited cross reference
     information in the sources named.	_l_x_r_e_f will scan the
     source and when it comes across a definition of a function
     (that is a line beginning with `(_d_e_f' it will preceed that
     line with a list of the functions which call this function,
     written as a comment preceeded by `;.. ' . All existing
     lines beginning with `;.. ' will be removed from the file.
     If the source file contains a line beginning `;.-' then this
     will disable this annotation process from this point on
     until a `;.+' is seen (however, lines beginning with `;.. '
     will continue to be deleted).  After the annoation is done,
     the original file `_f_o_o._l' is renamed to " `#._f_o_o._l'" and the
     new file with annotation is named `_f_o_o._l'
