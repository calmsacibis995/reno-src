     _L_i_s_p is a lisp interpreter for a dialect which closely
     resembles MIT's MACLISP.  This lisp, known as FRANZ LISP,
     features an I/O facility which allows the user to change the
     input and output syntax, add macro characters, and maintain
     compatibility with upper-case only lisp systems; infinite
     precision integer arithmetic, and an error facility which
     allows the user to trap system errors in many different
     ways.  Interpreted functions may be mixed with code compiled
     by _l_i_s_z_t(1) and both may be debugged using the ``Joseph Lis-
     ter'' trace package.  A _l_i_s_p containing compiled and inter-
     preted code may be dumped into a file for later use.

     There are too many functions to list here; one should refer
     to the manuals listed below.

     An early version was written by Jeff Levinsky, Mike Curry,
     and John Breedlove.  Keith Sklower wrote and is maintaining
     the current version, with the assistance of John Foderaro.
     The garbage collector was implemented by Bill Rowan.

     The error system is in a state of flux and not all error
     messages are as informative as they could be.
