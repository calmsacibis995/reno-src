Many variables which are used to describe the terminal environment

type	name	description
_
WINDOW *	curscr	T{
.fi
current version of the screen (terminal screen).
T}
WINDOW *	stdscr	T{
standard screen.  Most updates are usually done here.
T}
char *	Def\*_term	T{
default terminal type if type cannot be determined
T}
bool	My\*_term	T{
use the terminal specification in \fIDef\*_term\fR as terminal,
irrelevant of real terminal type
T}
char *	ttytype	T{
full name of the current terminal.
T}
int	LINES	T{

.ta 11n
.(b L
.nf
reg	storage class ``register'' (\fIe.g.\fP, \fIreg int i;\fR\|)
bool	boolean type, actually a ``char'' (\fIe.g.\fP, \fIbool doneit;\fR\|)
TRUE	boolean ``true'' flag (1).
FALSE	boolean ``false'' flag (0).
