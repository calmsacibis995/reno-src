This document provides an introduction to the interprocess
communication facilities included in the
4.3BSD release of the
.UX *
system.
.PP
It discusses the overall model for interprocess communication
and introduces the interprocess communication primitives
which have been added to the system.  The majority of the
document considers the use of these primitives in developing
applications.  The reader is expected to be familiar with
the C programming language as all examples are written in C.
