.SH NAME
ct \- CS/80 cartridge tape interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "tape ct0 at hpib? slave ?"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cartridge tape interface as found in the 7946 and 9144 products
provides a standard tape drive interface as described in
.IR mtio (4)
with the following exceptions:
.TP 3
1.
There is only one density.
.TP 3
2.
Only the ``raw'' interface is supported.
.TP 3
3.
The MTIOCTOP
.I ioctl

In particular, the command, MTFSR is not supported.
.TP 3
4.
The MTIOCGET

is not supported.
.TP 3
5.
The record size for read and write operations must be between
1K and 64K inclusive.
.PP
Special files
.I rct0
through
.I rct3
refer to rewind on close interfaces to drives 0 to 3.
.I Rct4
through
.I rct7
refer to no-rewind interfaces.
.I Rct8
through
.I rct11
refer to streaming rewind on close interfaces. (Only 9144 type devices
can stream.)
.I Rct12
through
.I rct15
refer to streaming no-rewind interfaces.
