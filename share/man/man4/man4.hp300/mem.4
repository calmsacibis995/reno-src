.SH NAME
mem, kmem \- main memory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.lg
.I Mem
is a special file that is an image of the main memory
of the computer.
It may be used, for example, to examine
(and even to patch) the system.
.PP
Byte addresses in
.I mem
are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
References to non-existent locations cause errors to be returned.
On the HP300, the last byte of physical memory is always
0xFFFFFFFF.
Hence, on an HP300 with 8Mb of memory, physical memory would
start at 0xFF800000.
.PP
The file
.I kmem
is the same as 
.I mem
except that kernel virtual memory
rather than physical memory is accessed.
Only kernel virtual addresses that are mapped to memory are allowed.
On the HP300, kernel virtual memory runs from 0 to about 0x2400000.
