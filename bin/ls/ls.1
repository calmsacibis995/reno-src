.SH NAME
ls \- list contents of directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ls
[
.B \-1AaCcdFfgikLlqRrstu
] [ file ... ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
For each directory argument,
.I ls
lists the contents of the directory;
for each file argument,
.I ls
repeats its name and any other information requested.
By default, the output is sorted alphabetically.
When no argument is given, the current directory is listed.
When several arguments are given,
the arguments are first sorted appropriately,
but file arguments are processed
before directories and their contents.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B \-1
force one entry per line output format; this is the default when
output is not to a terminal.
.TP
.B \-A
List all entries except for ``.'' and ``..''.
Always set for the super-user.
.TP
.B \-a
List all entries; in the absence of this option, entries whose
names begin with a period
.RB ( . )
are
.I not
listed.
.TP
.B \-C
force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.
.TP
.B \-c
Use time when file status was last changed for sorting or printing.
.TP
.B \-d
If argument is a directory, list only its name;
often used with \fB\-l\fR to get the status of a directory.
.TP
.B \-f
Don't sort the output.
.TP
.B \-F
cause directories to be marked with a trailing `/',
sockets with a trailing `=',
symbolic links with a trailing `@', and executable
files with a trailing `*'.
.TP
.B \-g
Include the group ownership of the file in a long output.
.TP
.B \-i
For each file, print the i-number in the first column of the report.
.TP
.B -k
Modifies the
.I -s
option, causing the sizes to be reported in kilobytes.
.TP
.B \-L
If argument is a symbolic link, list the file or directory the link references
rather than the link itself.
.TP
.B \-l
List in long format, giving type and mode (in the format described by
.IR strmode (3)),
number of links, owner, size in bytes, and time of last modification
for each file.
If the file is a special file the size field will instead contain
the major and minor device numbers.
If the file is a symbolic link the pathname of
the linked-to file is printed preceded by ``\->''.
.TP
.B \-q
force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as
the character `?'; this is the default when output is to a terminal.
.TP
.B \-R
recursively list subdirectories encountered.
.TP
.B \-r
Reverse the order of sort to get reverse alphabetic
or oldest first as appropriate.
.TP
.B \-s
Display the sizes of files and directories in 512-byte blocks.
.TP
.B \-t
Sort by time modified (latest first) instead of
by name.
.TP
.B \-u
Use time of last access instead of last
modification for sorting
(with the \fB\-t\fP option)
and/or printing (with the \fB\-l\fP option).
.PP
The
.IR -1 ,
.IR -C ,
and
.I -l
options all override each other; the last one specified determines
the format used.
.PP
The
.IR -c ,
and
.I -u
options override each other; the last one specified determines
the file time used.
.PP
When the sizes of the files in a directory
are listed, a total count of blocks,
including indirect blocks is printed.
.SH FILES
/etc/passwd to get user id's for
`ls \-l'.
.br
/etc/group to get group id's for
`ls \-g'.
.SH BUGS
The option setting based on whether the output is a teletype is
undesirable as ``ls\ \-s'' is much different than ``ls\ \-s\ |\ lpr''.
On the other hand, not doing this setting would make old shell scripts
which used
.I ls
almost certain losers.
