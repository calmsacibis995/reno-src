.Nm rmdir
.Nd remove directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rmdir
.Op Fl p
.Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The rmdir utility removes the directory entry specified by
each
.Ar directory
argument, provided it is empty.
.Pp
Arguments are processed in the order given.
In order to remove both a parent directory and a subdirectory
of that parent, the subdirectory
must be specified first so the parent directory
is empty when
.Nm rmdir
tries to remove it.
.\" .Pp
.\" The following option is available:
.\" .Tw Ds
.\" .Tp Fl p
.\" Each
.\" .Ar directory
.\" argument is treated as a pathname of which all
.\" components will be removed, if they are empty,
.\" starting with the last most component.
.\" (See
.\" .Xr rm 1
.\" for fully non-discriminant recursive removal).
.Pp
The
.Nm rmdir
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Tw Ds
.Tp Li \&0
Each directory entry specified by a dir operand
referred to an empty directory and was removed
successfully.
.Tp Li \&>\&0
An error occurred.
.Tp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rm 1

function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
