.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Timedc
is used to control the operation of the \fItimed\fP program.
It may be used to:
.IP \(bu
measure the differences between machines' clocks,
.IP \(bu
find the location where the master time server is running,
.IP \(bu
enable or disable tracing of messages received by \fItimed\fP, and
.IP \(bu
perform various debugging actions.
.PP
Without any arguments,
.I timedc
will prompt for commands from the standard input.
If arguments are supplied,
.IR timedc
interprets the first argument as a command and the remaining
