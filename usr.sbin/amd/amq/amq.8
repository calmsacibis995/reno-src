.SH NAME
amq \- automounter query tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B amq

.BI \-h " hostname"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Amq
provides a simple way of determining the current state of
.B amd
program.
Communication is by
.SM RPC.
Three modes of operation are supported by the current protocol.
By default a list of mount points and auto-mounted filesystems
is output.
An alternative host can be specified using the
.I \-h
option.
.LP
If directory names are given, as output by default,
then per-filesystem information is displayed.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.I \-h
option specifies an alternate host to query.
By default the local host is used.  In an
.SM HP-UX
cluster, the root server is queried by default, since
that is the system on which the automounter is normally run.
.LP
The
.I \-f
option asks the automounter to flush the internal
mount map cache.
The
.I \-m
option asks the automounter to provide a list of mounted filesystems,
including the number of references to each filesystem and any error
which occured while mounting.
The
.I \-s
option asks the automounter to provide system-wide mount statistics.
.LP
The
.I \-u
option asks the automounter to unmount the named filesystems
instead of providing information about them.  Unmounts are requested,
not forced.  They merely cause the mounted filesystem to timeout,
which will be picked up by
.BR amd 's
main scheduler thus causing the normal timeout action to be taken.
