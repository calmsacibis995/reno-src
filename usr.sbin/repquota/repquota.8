.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Repquota
prints a summary of the disk usage and quotas for the
specified file systems.
If the \fI-a\fP flag is used,
.I repquota
prints the quotas of all the filesystems listed in
.IR /etc/fstab .
.PP
By default both user and group quotas are printed if they exist.
The optional \fI-g\fP flag specifies that only group quotas should be printed.
The optional \fI-u\fP flag specifies that only user quotas should be printed.
Specifying both \fI-g\fP and \fI-u\fP is equivalent to the default.
.PP
For each user or group, the current
number files and amount of space (in kilobytes) is
printed, along with any quotas created with
.IR edquota (8).
If the \fI-v\fP flag is specified,
a header line is printed preceding each filesystems quotas.
.PP
Only members of the operator group or the super-user may
use this command.

.DT
\fIquota.user\fP	at the filesystem root with user quotas
.br
\fIquota.group\fP	at the filesystem root with group quotas
.br
