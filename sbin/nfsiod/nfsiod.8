.SH NAME
nfsiod \- local NFS asynchronous I/O server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nfsiod
[
.B numdaemons
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nfsiod
runs on an
.SM NFS
client machine to service asynchronous I/O requests to its server.
It improves performance but is not required for correct operation.
The option
.I numdaemons
defines how many
.I nfsiod
daemons to start;
if unspecified, only a single daemon will be started.
A client should typically run enough daemons to handle
their maximum level of concurrency,
typically four to six.
