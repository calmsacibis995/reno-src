.SH NAME
exports \- define remote mount points for NFS mount requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/exports
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Exports
specifies remote mount points for the
.SM NFS
mount protocol per the
.SM NFS
server specification; see
``Network File System Protocol Specification, RFC1094''.
.LP
Each line in the file specifies one remote mount point.
The first field is the mount point directory path followed
optionally by export options and specific hosts separated by white space.
Only the first entry for a given local file system may specify the export
options, since these are handled on a \fIper local file system\fR basis.
If no specific hosts are specified,
the mount point is exported to all hosts.
.LP
The export options are as follows:
.B \-root=<uid>
specifies how to map root's uid (default -2).
The option \fB\-r\fR is synonyms for \fB\-root\fP
in an effort to be backward compatible with older export file formats.
.sp
.B \-ro
specifies that the file system should be exported Read-only
(default Read/Write).
The option \fB-o\fR is synonyms for \fB\-ro\fP
in an effort to be backward compatible with older export file formats.
.LP
For example:
.RS
/usr -root=0 rickers snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca
.br
/usr/local 131.104.48.16
.br
/u -root=5
.br
/u2 -ro
.RE
.sp
given that \fB/usr\fR, \fB/u\fR and \fB/u2\fR are
local file system mount points, specifies the following:
.RS
\fB/usr\fR
is exported to hosts \fIrickers\fR and \fIsnowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca\fR with
root mapped to root.
.br
\fB/usr/local\fR
is exported to host \fI131.104.48.16\fR with root mapped to root.
.br
\fB/u\fR
is exported to all hosts with root mapped to uid 5.
.br
\fB/u2\fR
is exported to all hosts Read-only with root mapped to -2.
.RE
.LP
Note that \fB/usr/local -root=5\fR would have been incorrect,
since \fB/usr\fR and \fB/usr/local\fR reside in the same local file system.

.SH BUGS
It would be nice if the export options were not tied to local mount points.
